# External Resources Guide

> Curated links to official Anthropic documentation organized by use case.

This folder provides navigation to external documentation resources. Content is organized by **what you're trying to do**, not by source. Use this as a starting point to find the right resources for your task.

## Quick Navigation

| I want to... | Start here |
|--------------|------------|
| Learn prompt engineering | [prompt-engineering.md](prompt-engineering.md) |
| Build agents or subagents | [agent-development.md](agent-development.md) |
| Use the Claude API | [api-reference.md](api-reference.md) |
| Learn through tutorials | [tutorials-courses.md](tutorials-courses.md) |
| Work with MCP | [mcp-resources.md](mcp-resources.md) |
| Find GitHub repos | [github-repositories.md](github-repositories.md) |

## How to Use This Guide

Each file contains:
- **Official sources** marked with source domain
- **One-line descriptions** to help you decide what to read
- **Links organized by subtopic** within each use case

## Local vs. External Resources

For the most frequently-referenced content, we've saved local copies in `../12-best-practices/`. Check there first for:
- Claude Code best practices
- Building effective agents
- Context engineering
- Tool use fundamentals
- Prompt engineering overview

This guide (`13-external-resources-guide/`) points to **everything else** that's available online.

## Keeping Links Fresh

External links may change over time. If you find a broken link:
1. Try the domain root (e.g., anthropic.com/engineering)
2. Search the site for the topic
3. Check if content moved to a new URL structure
